description = """The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package
provides a portable abstraction (across OS, versions, architectures, ...) of
the hierarchical topology of modern architectures, including NUMA memory nodes,
sockets, shared caches, cores and simultaneous multithreading. It also gathers
various system attributes such as cache and memory information as well as the
locality of I/O devices such as network interfaces, InfiniBand HCAs or GPUs. It
primarily aims at helping applications with gathering information about modern
computing hardware so as to exploit it accordingly and efficiently."""
