language. Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description
constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is
dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual
machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage
collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid
prototyping."""
