    libaec - Adaptive Entropy Coding library

    Libaec provides fast lossless compression of 1 up to 32 bit wide
    signed or unsigned integers (samples). The library achieves best
    results for low entropy data as often encountered in space imaging
    instrument data or numerical model output from weather or climate
    simulations. While floating point representations are not directly
    supported, they can also be efficiently coded by grouping exponents
    and mantissa.

    *****************  SZIP compatibility *********************** 
    Libaec includes a free drop-in replacement for the SZIP library (http://www.hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP). 
    Just replace SZIP's shared library libsz.so* with libaec.so* and libsz.so* from libaec. 
    Code which is dynamically linked with SZIP such as HDF5 should continue to work with libaec. 
    No re-compilation required. HDF5 files which contain SZIP encoded data can be decoded by HDF5 
    using libaec and vice versa.
