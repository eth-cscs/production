description = """SIONlib is a scalable I/O library for parallel access to
task-local files.  The library not only supports writing and reading binary
data to or from several thousands of processors into a single or a small number
of physical files, but also provides global open and close functions to access
SIONlib files in parallel. This package provides a stripped-down installation
of SIONlib for use with performance tools (e.g., Score-P), with renamed symbols
to avoid conflicts when an application using SIONlib itself is linked against a
tool requiring a different SIONlib version."""
