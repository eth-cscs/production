# Compute Budget
Computer time on Cray systems will be accounted in node hours; computing time on CSCS systems for data pre- and post-processing needs to be requested separately, and it will be accounted in core hours, on the machines that allow node sharing.

Note that resources at CSCS are assigned over three-month windows. Quotas are reset on April 1st, July 1st, October 1st and January 1st, therefore please make sure to use thoroughly your quarterly compute budget within the corresponding time frame.

Two different scripts let you check your compute budget on the systems in the current allocation window. Please login in on the system you are interested in and run the commands:
